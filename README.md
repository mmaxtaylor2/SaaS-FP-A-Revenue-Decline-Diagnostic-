# SaaS-FP&A Revenue Decline Diagnostic
Driver-Based Financial Planning &amp; Executive Performance Analysis 

## Business Question 

Why is subscription revenue declining despite strong gross margins, and which operational levers matter most for restoring sustainable growth and profitability?

This project examines whether revenue deterioration is driven by customer churn dynamics, insufficient new customer acquisition, or internal cost structure decisions — and how FP&A teams should diagnose and respond.

## Why This Matters 

In SaaS businesses, revenue slowdowns are often misattributed to short-term market conditions rather than underlying customer behavior. FP&A teams are responsible for moving beyond surface-level variances and identifying the **true drivers of performance deterioration**.

This analysis mirrors real-world FP&A responsibilities such as:

Monthly actuals vs. budget variance analysis
Executive and board-level performance reviews
Re-forecasting and resource allocation decisions

The objective is not simply to forecast revenue, but to explain **why performance is deviating from plan and what actions leadership should take as a result.**

## Analytical Framework 

The model is constructed as an end-to-end, driver-based SaaS FP&A system designed to replicate how finance teams analyze operating performance:

Customer cohort modeling (new adds, churned customers, net change)
Monthly MRR build and ARR roll-forward driven by customer behavior
Revenue mix analysis (subscription vs. services)
Gross margin modeling and operating expense structure
EBITDA and cash flow impact
Six-chart executive dashboard highlighting key performance drivers

All outputs are linked dynamically to underlying operating assumptions to ensure transparency and traceability.

## Key Assumptions

Customer growth and churn are modeled as primary revenue drivers
Subscription revenue represents the core economic engine of the business
Gross margins remain structurally strong (~80%), consistent with mature SaaS models
Operating expenses are partially fixed, creating operating leverage risk as revenue slows

Assumptions are designed to reflect realistic SaaS economics rather than best-case outcomes.

## Key Findings 

Revenue decline is driven primarily by **sustained customer churn exceeding new customer adds**, rather than pricing or demand collapse
Gross margins remain strong (~80%), indicating the revenue issue is not cost-of-delivery related
EBITDA margins deteriorate as fixed operating expenses grow faster than revenue
Subscription revenue remains the dominant revenue driver, with services providing limited offset

These results suggest the revenue problem is structural and customer-driven, not temporary or purely macro-related.

## Decision Implications 

Retention-focused initiatives deliver higher ROI than incremental customer acquisition spend
Operating expense growth must be re-phased to align with net revenue realities
Leadership should prioritize churn reduction before pursuing aggressive growth targets
Forecasts and budgets should be rebuilt around customer behavior rather than top-line assumptions

This project demonstrates how FP&A teams translate operating data into **decision-relevant insight**, rather than static financial reporting.
